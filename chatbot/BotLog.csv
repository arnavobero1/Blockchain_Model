What is a blockchain?,"For practical purposes, a blockchain serves as a digital and decentralized ledger with a variety of applications."
What is blockchain?,"For practical purposes, a blockchain serves as a digital and decentralized ledger with a variety of applications."
Why is blockchain better?,"Blockchain takes away the control of records and therefore the scope of tampering away from a single entity and distributes it to everyone in the chain. Further, VAC has three levels of security namely, peer approval, proof of work and signed transactions."
Why is blockchain so popular?,"Blockchain takes away the control of records and therefore the scope of tampering away from a single entity and distributes it to everyone in the chain. Further, VAC has three levels of security namely, peer approval, proof of work and signed transactions."
How is blockchain safe?,"Blockchain takes away the control of records and therefore the scope of tampering away from a single entity and distributes it to everyone in the chain. Further, VAC has three levels of security namely, peer approval, proof of work and signed transactions."
Is a blockchain safe?,"Blockchain is an advent in the sphere of cyber security. While it is not technically impossible to take over a blockchain for a hacker, it is definitely virtually so. In order to gain control over the ledger, the hacker’s changes would require the approval and proof of work of over 50% of the blocks in the chain and the digital signatures pertaining to each of the blocks."
Can a blockchain be hacked? ,"Blockchain is an advent in the sphere of cyber security. While it is not technically impossible to take over a blockchain for a hacker, it is definitely virtually so. In order to gain control over the ledger, the hacker’s changes would require the approval and proof of work of over 50% of the blocks in the chain and the digital signatures pertaining to each of the blocks."
Why are blockchain stocks rising?,"Coupled with its status as the most secure manner of holding assets virtually and the digital shift in people’s lives across the globe, blockchain is the most sought after technological front in the world at the moment and for the future."
Why should I invest in blockchain? ,"Coupled with its status as the most secure manner of holding assets virtually and the digital shift in people’s lives across the globe, blockchain is the most sought after technological front in the world at the moment and for the future."
Why is it better to invest in blockchains?,"Coupled with its status as the most secure manner of holding assets virtually and the digital shift in people’s lives across the globe, blockchain is the most sought after technological front in the world at the moment and for the future."
How do other people in the blockchain approve of a transaction?, Proof of work is often an inconsequential mathematical equation that the people in the blockchain solve in order to add a proposed transaction to the chain. The people solving the equation get incentive for performing the task and this is referred to as mining. This ensures that a transaction cannot immediately be approved and added to the chain thereby maintaining the sanctity of the chain.

Effect of size of blockchain?,"As a blockchain grows, the amount of control each person has over transactions decreases thereby making it more secure. Therefore, with popularity and security, being a part of the chain or holding assets in the chain becomes more desirable and hence more profitable/sought after."
What are signed transactions?,"Like signatures in real life, digital signatures in a blockchain are characterised by two keys, namely, private and public key. In order to make a transaction, a person would require both the keys so as to bypass the third layer of security."
What are digital signatures?,"Like signatures in real life, digital signatures in a blockchain are characterised by two keys, namely, private and public key. In order to make a transaction, a person would require both the keys so as to bypass the third layer of security."

is blockchain safe?,"Blockchain is an advent in the sphere of cyber security. While it is not technically impossible to take over a blockchain for a hacker, it is definitely virtually so. To gain control over the ledger, the hacker changes would require the approval and proof of work of over fifty percent of the blocks in the chain and the digital signatures pertaining to each of the blocks."
